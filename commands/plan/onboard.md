New project onboarding. Scans a codebase and generates a comprehensive orientation: architecture, key decisions, dependency map, environment setup, and first tasks.

## Steps

### Step 1: Locate the project

If the user specified a directory, use that. Otherwise, use the current working directory.

If the user passed a URL (e.g., `https://github.com/...` or `git@github.com:...`), stop and ask them to clone it first:

```
This command operates on a local directory only. Please clone the repo first:
  git clone <url> ~/workspace/<name>
Then re-run: /k0d3:onboard ~/workspace/<name>
```

Verify the target is a real project (has package.json, Cargo.toml, pyproject.toml, go.mod, or equivalent).

### Step 2: Structural scan (parallel)

**Scan 1 — Project identity:**

- Read README, CONTRIBUTING, CHANGELOG if they exist
- Read package.json / Cargo.toml / pyproject.toml for metadata
- Identify: language, framework, build tool, test framework
- Count: total files, lines of code, number of dependencies

**Scan 2 — Architecture:**

- Map the directory structure (top 3 levels)
- Identify architectural pattern (MVC, hexagonal, monolith, microservices, serverless)
- Find entry points (main files, route definitions, handlers)
- Locate config files (env, yaml, json configs)

**Scan 3 — Key files:**

- Find the 10 most-changed files (`git log --format='' --name-only | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -20`)
- Find the largest files (likely important or problematic)
- Locate test directories and test patterns

### Step 3: Dependency analysis

- List direct dependencies with versions
- Flag any outdated or deprecated packages (check for major version gaps)
- Identify critical dependencies (the ones the project can't function without)
- Note any unusual or niche dependencies worth understanding

### Step 4: Code patterns

Read 3-5 representative files to identify:

- Naming conventions (camelCase, snake_case, etc.)
- Error handling patterns
- Logging approach
- State management (if frontend)
- Database access patterns (if backend)
- Authentication / authorisation approach

### Step 5: Git archaeology

```bash
git log --oneline -20
```

From recent history:

- What's being actively worked on?
- Who are the main contributors?
- What's the commit style? (conventional commits, free-form, etc.)
- Any long-running branches?

### Step 6: Generate the onboarding guide

Save to `ONBOARDING.md` (or output directly):

```markdown

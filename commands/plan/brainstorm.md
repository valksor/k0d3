# /brainstorm

Invokes `Skill(k0d3:brainstorming)` and starts the design-before-code dialogue.

Argument `[topic]` (optional): seed text for the brainstorming session ("e.g. add notifications", "rate-limit the orders API"). If omitted, the assistant asks what you want to design.

Terminal state: an approved spec and an invocation of `Skill(k0d3:planning)` to write the implementation plan.

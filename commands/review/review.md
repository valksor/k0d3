Comprehensive code review. Goes beyond style — checks security, performance, architecture, and generates actionable improvement suggestions.

## Steps

### Step 1: Determine scope

Identify what to review:

- If user specified a file or directory → review that
- If user specified a PR or branch → `git diff main...HEAD` (or appropriate base)
- If nothing specified → review staged changes (`git diff --cached`) or recent commits

### Step 2: Read the code

Read all files in scope. For large diffs, focus on:

- New files (highest risk — no prior review)
- Files with the most changes
- Test files (or lack thereof)

### Step 3: Multi-dimensional review (single-pass, in-thread)

This command performs a single-pass review in the current thread — it does NOT dispatch the calibrated reviewer cohort (use `/k0d3:review-impl` for that). Cover all three lenses:

**Security review:**

- Input validation (SQL injection, XSS, command injection)
- Authentication / authorisation gaps
- Secrets or credentials in code
- Unsafe dependencies
- OWASP Top 10 checklist

**Performance review:**

- N+1 queries or unnecessary database calls
- Missing indexes (if schema visible)
- Unbounded loops or recursion
- Large memory allocations
- Missing caching opportunities
- Unnecessary re-renders (React) or recomputations

**Architecture review:**

- Does this follow existing patterns in the codebase?
- Is responsibility clearly separated?
- Are there circular dependencies?
- Is the abstraction level appropriate? (over-engineered or under-abstracted)
- Will this be easy to test, debug, and maintain?

For a deeper review where each lens is run by a dedicated calibrated agent with explicit blocker/concern/advisory classification, use `/k0d3:review-impl` instead.

### Step 4: Compile findings

Categorise each finding:

| Severity     | Meaning                                                                        |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **CRITICAL** | Must fix before merge — security vulnerability, data loss risk, breaking bug   |
| **HIGH**     | Should fix — performance issue, architectural concern, maintainability problem |
| **MEDIUM**   | Consider fixing — code smell, minor inefficiency, readability improvement      |
| **LOW**      | Nit — style preference, naming suggestion, comment improvement                 |

### Step 5: Generate the review

Output a structured review:

```markdown
## Code Review — [scope]

### Summary

[1-2 sentences: overall assessment and top concern]

### Critical Issues

- **[File:line]** — [issue and why it matters]
  **Fix:** [specific code suggestion]

### High Priority

- **[File:line]** — [issue]
  **Fix:** [suggestion]

### Medium Priority

- [bullets]

### What's Good

- [specific things done well — always include positives]

### Verdict

[APPROVE / APPROVE WITH CHANGES / REQUEST CHANGES]
[One sentence rationale]
```

### Step 6: Offer to fix

Ask the user: "Want me to fix the critical and high-priority issues now?"

If yes, apply fixes directly. If no, the review stands as documentation.

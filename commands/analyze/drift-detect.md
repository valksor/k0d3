Self-monitoring command. Scans your entire Claude Code configuration for drift — stale rules, contradictions, orphaned files, and configuration inconsistencies.

## Scope detection (Step 0)

Resolve the target paths the same way `/system-audit` does:

```bash
if [[ -d "agents" && -d "commands" && -d "hooks" && -d "skills" ]]; then
  TARGET_AGENTS="agents"; TARGET_COMMANDS="commands"; TARGET_HOOKS="hooks"; TARGET_SKILLS="skills"
else
  TARGET_AGENTS=".claude/agents"; TARGET_COMMANDS=".claude/commands"; TARGET_HOOKS=".claude/hooks"; TARGET_SKILLS=".claude/skills"
fi
```

Apply these to every reference to `.claude/agents/`, `.claude/commands/`, `.claude/skills/`, `.claude/hooks/` in the checks below.

## Steps

### Step 1: Scan system files (parallel)

Read all configuration sources simultaneously:

- `CLAUDE.md` — project instructions
- `.claude/memory.md` — active memory
- `.claude/knowledge-base.md` — learned rules
- `.claude/settings.json` — hooks configuration
- `.claude/command-index.md` — command registry (if exists)

### Step 2: Check for contradictions

**Within CLAUDE.md:**

- Are there conflicting instructions? (e.g., "always do X" and "never do X")
- Are there references to files or directories that don't exist?
- Are there references to commands or agents that aren't defined?

**Between CLAUDE.md and knowledge-base:**

- Does the knowledge base contain rules that contradict CLAUDE.md?
- Are there duplicate rules across both files?

**Between memory and reality:**

- Does memory reference tasks, files, or states that no longer exist?
- Are there "current focus" items that are clearly stale?

### Step 3: Check for orphans

Scan for:

- **Orphaned commands:** Files in `$TARGET_COMMANDS/` not referenced in command-index.md
- **Orphaned agents:** Agent definitions in `$TARGET_AGENTS/` with no command or skill that invokes them
- **Orphaned skills:** Skills in `$TARGET_SKILLS/` not referenced by any command, agent, or CLAUDE.md
- **Dead references:** Mentions of files, URLs, or paths that don't exist
- **Unused hooks:** Hook scripts in `$TARGET_HOOKS/` that exist but aren't wired in settings.json

### Step 4: Check for staleness

- **Memory.md:** Is "Now" section from more than 3 days ago?
- **Knowledge-base entries:** Do any reference outdated tools, APIs, or patterns?

### Step 5: Check memory corpus integrity

Keep the memory stores consistent. The project-local check runs with this command's tools (`Read` / `Grep`); the global auto-memory sweep is manual (that dir lives outside the project, so project-scoped Glob/Grep can't reach it). Report entity and file **names only** — never quote stored values, since the JSONL store is plaintext and a report may be shared.

- **Knowledge-graph ↔ markdown drift (project-local):** the rule is "don't write the same fact into both stores — they drift." If `.claude/memory.jsonl` exists (it's gitignored runtime state — skip this sub-check if absent), list entity names with `grep '"name":' .claude/memory.jsonl` and check whether the same fact also lives in `knowledge-base.md`; flag duplicates by name, and graph entities whose observations reference removed files, tools, or APIs.
- **Global auto-memory sweep (manual):** the auto-memory corpus — a `MEMORY.md` index plus one `.md` file per fact, cross-linked with `[[slug]]` wiki-links — lives outside the project. When asked to sweep it, point `Read` / `Grep` at that dir and flag: index lines whose target file is missing, fact files absent from the index, and dangling `[[slug]]` links (a slug with no matching file). Match `[[kebab-slug]]` note references only — ignore code/TOML/shell double-brackets such as `[[ -f x ]]` or `[[tool.mypy]]`. Note in the report whether this sweep ran or was skipped.

### Step 6: Check configuration health

- **settings.json:** Is `.claude/settings.json` valid JSON? (always at project `.claude/`, regardless of MODE)
- **Hook scripts executable?** Check `$TARGET_HOOKS/*.sh` — each should have +x. List any without it.
- **CLAUDE.md size:** Is it growing too large? (>500 lines is a warning)
- **Memory.md size:** Is it within limits? (<100 lines target)
- **Knowledge-base size:** Is it within limits? (<200 lines target)

### Step 7: Generate drift report

```markdown
# Drift Detection Report

**Date:** [date]
**Status:** [CLEAN / WARNINGS / ISSUES FOUND]

## Contradictions Found

- [contradiction with file references]

## Orphaned Items

- [orphaned file or reference]

## Stale Items

- [stale memory, task, or reference]

## Memory Corpus

- [knowledge-graph ↔ markdown drift; if the global sweep ran, index/wiki-link orphans — else note it was skipped]

## Configuration Health

| Check                   | Status    | Note           |
| ----------------------- | --------- | -------------- |
| settings.json valid     | Pass/Fail |                |
| CLAUDE.md size          | [lines]   | [ok / warning] |
| memory.md size          | [lines]   | [ok / warning] |
| knowledge-base size     | [lines]   | [ok / warning] |
| Hook scripts executable | Pass/Fail |                |

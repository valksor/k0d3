Auto-generate release notes from git history. Produces audience-appropriate versions — technical changelog, marketing announcement, or executive summary — from the same data.

## Steps

### Step 1: Determine the range

Figure out what commits to include:

- If user specified a version → find the tag range (e.g., `git log v1.2.0..v1.3.0`)
- If user specified dates → use date range (`git log --after="2025-01-01" --before="2025-02-01"`)
- If nothing specified → changes since last tag (`git log $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)..HEAD`)

### Step 2: Gather commit data

```bash
git log [range] --format="%h %s" --no-merges
```

Also check:

- PR descriptions if available (`git log --merges` for merge commit messages)
- Any CHANGELOG entries
- Modified files to understand scope (`git diff --stat [range]`)

### Step 3: Categorise changes

Sort every change into:

| Category             | Icon     | Example                                       |
| -------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **New Features**     | Added    | New capability, new endpoint, new component   |
| **Improvements**     | Changed  | Performance boost, UX improvement, refactor   |
| **Bug Fixes**        | Fixed    | Resolved issue, corrected behaviour           |
| **Breaking Changes** | Breaking | API change, removed feature, migration needed |
| **Dependencies**     | Deps     | Updated packages, new dependencies            |
| **Internal**         | Internal | Tests, CI, docs, refactoring                  |

### Step 4: Write release notes (3 versions)

**Version 1 — Technical Changelog** (for developers):

```markdown
# [Version] — [Date]

## Breaking Changes

- [change with migration instructions]

## New Features

- [feature]: [description] ([commit hash])

## Improvements

- [improvement] ([commit hash])

## Bug Fixes

- [fix] ([commit hash])

## Dependencies

- Updated [package] from [old] to [new]
```

**Version 2 — Marketing Announcement** (for customers/public):

```markdown
# What's New in [Version]

[1-2 sentence hook — the most exciting change]

### [Feature Name]

[Benefit-focused description — what it means for the user, not how it works]

### [Improvement]

[User-facing improvement with before/after if applicable]

### Bug Fixes

[Summary — "Fixed X issues including..." — no commit hashes]
```

**Version 3 — Executive Summary** (for stakeholders):

```markdown
# Release Summary — [Version]

**Impact:** [one sentence — what this release accomplishes]

**Key changes:**

- [Top 3 changes, business-impact framing]

**Metrics:**

- [x] features added
- [x] bugs fixed
- [x] files changed

**Risk:** [any breaking changes or migration needs — or "None"]
```

### Step 5: Save and output

Save to `releases/[version]-release-notes.md` with all three versions.

Output the marketing version by default (most commonly needed), and mention the other versions are in the file.

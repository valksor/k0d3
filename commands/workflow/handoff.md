Generate a structured handoff briefing when passing work to another person or AI. Captures context, decisions, risks, and next steps so nothing gets lost in transition.

## Steps

### Step 1: Gather session context

Read:

- `.claude/memory.md` — current state
- Recent daily note — today's work log
- `Task Board.md` — active tasks and priorities
- `git status` and `git log --oneline -10` — recent changes

### Step 2: Identify what was done

From the session context and git history, list:

- **Completed:** Tasks finished in this session
- **In progress:** Work started but not finished (with current state)
- **Decisions made:** Choices and their rationale
- **Files touched:** Every file modified with a one-line summary of the change

### Step 3: Identify what's pending

- **Immediate next steps:** What should happen next (ordered)
- **Blocked items:** Tasks that can't proceed and why
- **Open questions:** Decisions that need input
- **Risks:** Anything that could go wrong if not handled

### Step 4: Context the recipient needs

- **Project context:** What is this project and what matters right now?
- **Key files:** Where to look for the most important things
- **Gotchas:** Non-obvious things that will trip someone up
- **Dependencies:** External people, services, or events this work depends on

### Step 5: Write the handoff

Save to `handoffs/handoff-[date]-[time].md`:

```markdown
# Session Handoff

**From:** [current session / your name]
**To:** [recipient if specified, otherwise "Next session"]
**Date:** [date and time]

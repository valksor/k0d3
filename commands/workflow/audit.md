Delegate a quality review to the auditor agent.

## Steps

### Step 1: Determine scope

If the user provided a specific scope (file, task, or area):

- Use that as the audit target

If no scope provided:

- Default to "today's work" — read the daily note for context

### Step 2: Select audit tier

| Tier | When                                          | Depth                                           |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| T1   | Daily wrap-up, quick check                    | Scan for obvious issues, 2-3 min                |
| T2   | After completing a feature or multi-step task | Check completeness, consistency, side effects   |
| T3   | Weekly review, after major changes            | Full regression check, knowledge-base sweep     |
| T4   | Monthly or after system changes               | Deep infrastructure audit, cross-file coherence |

Default to T2 for explicit `/audit` calls.

### Step 3: Delegate to auditor

Spawn the auditor agent with the appropriate tier and scope:

```
Agent(auditor): [Tier] audit of [scope].

Context:
- [Brief description of what was done]
- [Key files involved]

Check for:
1. Completeness — were all requirements met?
2. Consistency — do changes align with existing patterns?
3. Side effects — did changes break anything downstream?
4. Knowledge — are there learnings to promote or nominate?

Report findings as PASS/WARN/FAIL with specific file:line references.
```

### Step 4: Process results

- **PASS**: Log success, note any suggestions
- **WARN**: Log warnings, add to daily note
- **FAIL**: Log failures, add to incident log, create corrective tasks on Task Board

### Step 5: Update logs

Append audit results to daily note under a new section:

```markdown
## Audit — HH:MM (T[tier])

- Result: [PASS/WARN/FAIL]
- Findings: [bullets]
- Actions: [any corrective tasks created]
```

Break through a block. Uses the Unsticker agent for root-cause analysis and fresh approaches.

## Steps

### Step 1: Capture the stuck state

If the user described what they're stuck on, use that. Otherwise, infer from:

- Current memory.md → Now
- Last few tool calls in context

Articulate the block in one sentence: "I'm stuck on [X] because [Y]."

### Step 2: Classify the block

| Type                   | Signals                         | Approach                                              |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Knowledge gap**      | "I don't know how to..."        | Search docs, read source, check knowledge-base        |
| **Decision paralysis** | "I can't decide between..."     | List tradeoffs, pick the reversible option            |
| **Circular debugging** | Same error 3+ times             | Step back, restate the problem, try opposite approach |
| **Scope confusion**    | "This is bigger than I thought" | Yak-shave check — are you solving the right problem?  |
| **Environmental**      | Build/deploy/config issues      | Check logs, verify prerequisites, try clean state     |

### Step 3: Deploy the Unsticker

Spawn the unsticker agent:

```
Agent(unsticker): I'm stuck on [problem].

What I've tried: [list attempts]
Error/symptom: [what's happening]
Expected: [what should happen]

Break this down. What am I missing?
```

### Step 4: Execute the suggestion

Take the unsticker's top recommendation and try it immediately.
Don't deliberate — act. The fastest way out of stuck is through.

### Step 5: Capture the learning

If the fix reveals a reusable pattern, nominate it to `.claude/knowledge-nominations.md`:

```markdown
- [MMDDYY] /unstick: [block] → [fix] | Root cause: [why]
```

Otherwise just report the resolution to the user — no need to persist a one-off.

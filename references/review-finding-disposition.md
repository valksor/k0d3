# Review finding disposition

Shared protocol for `/k0d3:review-code`, `/k0d3:review-impl`, `/k0d3:review-plan`,
`/k0d3:review`, and `/k0d3:security-audit`. It defines what the orchestrator does **after**
a review has printed its categorized findings — regardless of which severity scheme the
calling command uses (Blockers / Concerns / Advisories, or Critical / High / Medium / Low /
Info).

This is the orchestrator's half of a contract the reviewer agents already state: _"the
orchestrator validates and dispositions every finding."_ Reviewers find and classify at true
severity; **dispositioning is your job, and it is not optional.**

## The protocol

Once the findings are printed, **do not stop and do not ask permission.** Disposition every
finding:

1. **Validate.** For each finding, open the cited `file:line` and read the **whole enclosing
   function or block** — not just the one line. Confirm the described problem is actually
   present in that context. Reviewers run without full repo context and produce false
   positives; **if you cannot reproduce the described problem from the code (or plan) itself,
   treat it as a false positive** and skip it (step 3). A finding is _valid_ only when you can
   see the problem in the real code.

   A finding is **also** a false positive when it proposes a _lateral rewrite_ — swapping
   working code, wording, or structure for an equally-valid alternative — or proposes
   _reversing a choice shown deliberate by an affirmative signal_ (a comment, docstring, test,
   or commit states the intent — not merely that it matches the surrounding code) without
   demonstrating a concrete defect. These are exactly the findings that make review oscillate:
   one session swaps A→B, the next swaps B→A, and nothing improves. Skip them (step 3). A
   finding earns a fix only when you can point to what is actually broken, risky, or failing —
   never to a preference. A genuine defect, though, is never a "deliberate choice": a hardcoded
   secret, a disabled security control, injection, or missing authz stays a finding even with
   an "intentional" comment.

2. **Fix every valid finding — all tiers.** Apply the remediation directly: edit the source
   (for `/review-plan`, revise the plan document). Fix Blockers, Concerns, and Advisories
   alike — and the equivalent Critical/High/Medium/Low/Info tiers. **Severity sets order, not
   whether to fix:** do blockers first, advisories last; never skip a tier just because it is
   low.

3. **Skip false positives.** If validation shows a finding is wrong, out of scope, or already
   handled, drop it — but say so in one line. Never silently discard a finding.

4. **Never ask for permission.** Do not write _"Want me to fix…?"_, _"Want me to add…?"_, or
   wait for approval. The user ran a review command to get the code fixed, not to receive a
   to-do list. Asking is the failure mode this protocol exists to prevent.

5. **Verify the fixes.** If you changed source, config, tests, or checked-in generated output,
   run the smallest meaningful project verification that exercises the touched area (test,
   lint, typecheck, build, or the repo's documented quality command). If the command reports
   errors or failures, **fix all errors in that output, not just the ones introduced by the
   review fixes**, then re-run the failing command. Continue until the relevant verification
   passes or you are genuinely blocked by missing credentials, access, or a user-only decision.
   If no runnable verification exists, say exactly what you inspected instead; do not call the
   work verified.

6. **Run a closure review.** After valid findings have been fixed, perform a follow-up review
   of the post-fix diff before reporting done. For calibrated commands (`/review-code`,
   `/review-impl`, `/review-plan`), this means one additional pass with the same review
   perspectives over the updated diff/plan, focused on whether the original findings are
   closed and whether the fixes introduced new Blockers or Concerns. For the single-pass
   `/review` and `security-audit` commands, do the same closure pass in-session against the
   updated diff. Disposition any new valid finding from that closure pass using this same
   protocol. Do not stop after merely proving that a review was run; the point is a clean,
   followed-up result.

7. **Report the disposition and closure evidence.** After fixing and follow-up, print a report:
   for each **fixed** finding, its tier and `(spec)`/`(code)` tag, `file:line`, and a one-line
   description of the change you made; for each **skipped** finding, the one-line reason — name
   the category (_false positive_, _lateral rewrite_, or _deliberate choice_) so the user can
   tell a deliberate skip from a missed defect. Close with the verification command(s) you ran
   and the follow-up review verdict. If verification or closure review could not be completed,
   state the exact blocker instead of implying the review is done.

**The `(spec)`/`(code)` tag is a routing hint, not a tier.** Reviewers tag each finding
`(spec)` (the work fails a requirement stated in the provided plan/spec) or `(code)` (a defect
independent of the spec — the default when no requirements were provided). Use it to aim the
fix: a `(spec)` finding means re-checking the change against the requirement and closing the
gap; a `(code)` finding means fixing the defect itself. Carry the tag through into the
disposition report. It never changes severity or the fix/skip decision — validate and fix
exactly as above.

**Never stage, commit, or push the fixes.** They land in the working tree only — leave them
there for the user to review.

## Guard clauses

**Local working tree only.** You can only fix what is in the local working tree. If the review
target is a remote PR or a ref that is not checked out locally, you cannot edit it — present
the validated findings with concrete, copy-pasteable remediations instead, and say why. (If
the user has checked the PR out locally, the fixes apply to that working tree like any other —
and, per above, you never push them.)

**Plan mode.** If Claude Code plan mode is active, _source_ edits are disallowed. Instead of
editing source, append the validated findings and their intended fixes to the active plan file
(path from system context) under a "Review findings" section, and say so. (`/review-plan` is
the exception: revising a plan document is prose editing, not a source edit, so `/review-plan`
always edits the reviewed plan document directly — even in plan mode.) Run the review and
disposition normally; only the _writes_ change target — never front-load a plan-mode question or
skip the review because edits are restricted.

## What this is NOT

- **Not a re-classification pass.** The consolidated severities stand — you validate whether a
  finding is _true_, not whether its tier is _right_.
- **Not a performative review.** Running reviewers is not completion. Completion means the
  first-pass findings were validated, valid ones were fixed, verification passed or was
  honestly blocked, and a closure review checked the post-fix diff.
- **Not a re-litigation of settled choices.** When the code already reflects a deliberate,
  equally-valid decision, a different-but-equivalent approach is not a defect — reversing it is
  how review becomes churn instead of value. Validate against what is broken, not against how
  you would have written it.

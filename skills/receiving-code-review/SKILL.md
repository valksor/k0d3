# Code Review Reception

Code review requires technical evaluation, not emotional performance. Adapted from `obra/superpowers:receiving-code-review`.

**Core principle:** verify before implementing. Ask before assuming. Technical correctness over social comfort.

## The response pattern

```
WHEN receiving code review feedback:
1. READ — complete feedback without reacting
2. UNDERSTAND — restate requirement in your own words (or ask)
3. VERIFY — check against codebase reality
4. EVALUATE — technically sound for THIS codebase?
5. RESPOND — technical acknowledgment or reasoned pushback
6. IMPLEMENT — one item at a time, test each
```

## Forbidden responses

**NEVER:**

- "You're absolutely right!" — explicit CLAUDE.md violation
- "Great point!" / "Excellent feedback!" — performative
- "Let me implement that now" — before verification

**INSTEAD:**

- Restate the technical requirement
- Ask clarifying questions
- Push back with technical reasoning if wrong
- Just start working — actions > words

## Handling unclear feedback

```
IF any item is unclear:
  STOP — do not implement anything yet
  ASK for clarification on unclear items
```

Items may be related. Partial understanding = wrong implementation.

**Example:**

> User: "Fix 1–6"
> You understand 1, 2, 3, 6. Unclear on 4, 5.
> ❌ WRONG: implement 1, 2, 3, 6 now; ask about 4, 5 later.
> ✅ RIGHT: "I understand items 1, 2, 3, 6. Need clarification on 4 and 5 before proceeding."

## Source-specific handling

**From the user (trusted):**

- Implement after understanding
- Still ask if scope unclear
- No performative agreement
- Skip to action or technical acknowledgment

**From external reviewers (skeptical):**

```
BEFORE implementing:
  1. Technically correct for THIS codebase?
  2. Breaks existing functionality?
  3. Reason for current implementation?
  4. Works on all platforms/versions?
  5. Reviewer understand full context?

IF suggestion seems wrong:
  Push back with technical reasoning

IF can't easily verify:
  Say so: "I can't verify this without [X]. Should I [investigate/ask/proceed]?"

IF conflicts with the user's prior decisions:
  Stop and discuss with the user first
```

## YAGNI check for "professional" features

```
IF reviewer suggests "implementing properly":
  grep codebase for actual usage
  IF unused: "This isn't called. Remove it (YAGNI)?"
  IF used: implement properly
```

## Implementation order

```
FOR multi-item feedback:
  1. Clarify anything unclear FIRST
  2. Then implement in this order:
     - Blocking (breaks, security)
     - Simple (typos, imports)
     - Complex (refactoring, logic)
  3. Test each fix individually
  4. Verify no regressions
```

## When to push back

- Suggestion breaks existing functionality
- Reviewer lacks full context
- Violates YAGNI (unused feature)
- Technically incorrect for this stack
- Legacy/compatibility reasons exist
- Conflicts with the user's architectural decisions

**How:** technical reasoning, not defensiveness. Ask specific questions. Reference working tests/code. Involve the user if architectural.

## Acknowledging correct feedback

```
✅ "Fixed. [Brief description of what changed]"
✅ "Good catch — [specific issue]. Fixed in [location]."
✅ [Just fix it and show in the code]

❌ "You're absolutely right!"
❌ "Great point!"
❌ "Thanks for catching that!"
❌ "Thanks for [anything]"
❌ ANY gratitude expression
```

Actions speak. Just fix it. The code itself shows you heard the feedback.

If you catch yourself about to write "Thanks": **DELETE IT.** State the fix instead.

## Gracefully correcting your pushback

If you pushed back and were wrong:

```
✅ "You were right — I checked [X] and it does [Y]. Implementing now."
✅ "Verified this and you're correct. My initial understanding was wrong because [reason]. Fixing."

❌ Long apology
❌ Defending why you pushed back
❌ Over-explaining
```

State the correction factually and move on.

## Common mistakes

| Mistake                      | Fix                                 |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Performative agreement       | State requirement or just act       |
| Blind implementation         | Verify against codebase first       |
| Batch without testing        | One at a time, test each            |
| Assuming reviewer is right   | Check if breaks things              |
| Avoiding pushback            | Technical correctness > comfort     |
| Partial implementation       | Clarify all items first             |
| Can't verify, proceed anyway | State limitation, ask for direction |

## GitHub thread replies

When replying to inline review comments on GitHub, reply in the comment thread (`gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pr}/comments/{id}/replies`), not as a top-level PR comment.

## The bottom line

External feedback = suggestions to evaluate, not orders to follow. **Verify. Question. Then implement.** No performative agreement. Technical rigor always.

# Testing Strategy

**Iron Law: behavior-coverage beats line-coverage. Unit for invariants, integration for collaboration, e2e for user journeys. Flakes are bugs, not noise.**

## The pyramid (proportions matter)

| Tier            | Speed             | Confidence per test   | Maintenance | Healthy share |
| --------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| **Unit**        | ms (sub-ms ideal) | Low (one piece)       | Low         | Most          |
| **Integration** | 100ms–10s         | High (a real seam)    | Medium      | Fewer         |
| **E2E**         | seconds–minutes   | Highest (whole stack) | High        | Fewest        |

Inverted ratio (many e2e, few unit) is a "test ice-cream cone" — slow, flaky, expensive.

## What each tier proves

| Tier            | Proves                                                                      |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Unit**        | One function/method behaves correctly on its inputs (invariants)            |
| **Integration** | Real components fit together at the seams — DB, HTTP, messaging, filesystem |
| **E2E**         | The full system delivers a user-visible journey                             |
| **Chaos**       | Behavior under injected faults (network, process, resource, time)           |
| **Property**    | Invariants hold across generated inputs (`Skill(testing-property-based)`)   |
| **Fuzz**        | No crashes for any input (`Skill(testing-fuzzing-mutation)`)                |
| **Mutation**    | Tests _fail_ when code is broken (`Skill(testing-fuzzing-mutation)`)        |

## Unit — fast, isolated, deterministic, one behavior

A unit is the smallest piece you'd change independently. **Not** a layer, not a module. Touches the network/disk/clock/DB → not a unit.

**AAA — Arrange, Act, Assert.** Two Acts = two tests.

```pseudo
def test_discount_caps_at_50_percent():
    # Arrange
    cart = Cart(items=[item(price=100)])
    coupon = Coupon(percent=80)
    # Act
    total = cart.apply(coupon).total()
    # Assert
    assert total == 50  # capped, not 20
```

**Names = documentation.** Pattern: `test_<thing>_<condition>_<expected>`. "And" in the name = split it.

**Isolation ≠ mock-everything.** Pure functions and small immediate collaborators: use the real thing. Mock external boundaries only.

**Don't test the framework.** Test the contract _you_ added, not the ORM's filter.

**Kill wobble:** inject the clock; seed PRNGs; sort before asserting; tolerances for floats; tmp dir fixtures; explicit env per test.

## Integration — real seams, real components

Real DB in a container. Real HTTP server on ephemeral port. Real client.

You need integration tests when:

- **Contract mismatch** (mocks lie — `user_id` vs `userId`).
- **Transaction/concurrency behavior** (isolation, locking, deadlocks).
- **Serialization/framing** (JSON edges, charsets, time zones).
- **Configuration glue** (env vars, secret loading, pool sizing).
- **N+1 / chattiness** (only visible against real latency).
- **Migration safety** (schema changes that compile but break runtime).

**Test data discipline** — pick one and stick with it:

| Strategy                               | Trade-off                                        |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Empty DB per test (or per class)       | Easy to reason; slower per test, faster to debug |
| Shared baseline + transaction rollback | Fast; harder to debug pollution                  |

Never share mutable records ("the test user with id=1"). One test renames it, the next breaks.

**Don't sleep — poll** on the actual condition (`wait_for(predicate, timeout=...)`). Bind to port 0 and read back. Freeze the clock at the boundary.

If your integration suite takes 40 minutes, you run it nightly and bugs reach `main`. Parallelize, reuse containers across tests, scope DB state per class.

## E2E — few, focused, robust

A confidence tool, not a coverage tool. **A few dozen e2e tests is plenty. Hundreds is a smell.**

For: sign up, log in, place order, password reset, smoke tests on deploy, cross-browser when that's a real concern.

**Not for:** every form field (unit/integration), every permission matrix (unit), validating component logic (component tests).

| Pattern                             | Notes                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Page Object Model**               | Wrap each page; selectors in one file; tests read like user intent      |
| **Selectors**                       | `data-testid` > accessible name/role > visible text > CSS class > XPath |
| **Auto-wait, never sleep**          | Wait on the _outcome_ ("URL is `/orders/123`"), not the animation       |
| **Seed via API**                    | Not via UI — UI seeding is itself flaky and slow                        |
| **Disable animations in test mode** | Pure flake fuel                                                         |
| **Capture artifacts on failure**    | Video, screenshot, network log, console log — CI uploads them           |

Smoke (≤10) runs on every deploy, < 2 min. Regression (the rest) runs nightly/pre-release, < 30 min.

CI retries hide flakes. Retry max once _with telemetry_; track flake rate.

## Flaky tests — root cause, not retry

A flake is either a bug in the test or a bug in the system, and the second case ships.

| Cause                   | Symptom                               | Fix                                                                   |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Time**                | Fails near midnight / DST / leap day  | Inject + freeze clock; test "+1 hour" not "23:30"                     |
| **Network**             | Fails on slow CI                      | Don't talk to real network; if you must, retry in setup not assertion |
| **Ordering**            | Fails when test order changes         | Per-test isolation; randomize order locally to catch dependencies     |
| **Shared state**        | Fails under parallelism               | Own DB schema / tmp dir / port per test                               |
| **Randomness**          | Fails with a specific seed            | Set seed deterministically; log seed on failure                       |
| **Race condition**      | Fails under load / on slower machines | Wait on the actual condition (poll), never `sleep()`                  |
| **Floating point**      | `0.30000000000000004`                 | Compare with tolerance                                                |
| **Iteration order**     | Fails after Python/Go map change      | Sort before asserting                                                 |
| **Data leakage**        | Fails when previous test ran          | Tear down; never trust clean state                                    |
| **External services**   | Fails when 3rd-party API down         | Mock at the boundary; contract-test the real API separately           |
| **Resource exhaustion** | Fails under memory pressure           | Fix leak; bound fixture resources                                     |

When investigating, walk this list. Cause is here 95% of the time.

**Anti-fixes that make flakes worse:**

| Anti-fix                                     | Why it's wrong                    |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `sleep(2)`                                   | Slower _and_ still flaky          |
| `@retry(3)` on the test                      | Hides the bug; ships to prod      |
| Excluding the test indefinitely              | Migrates the flake to other tests |
| Catching the exception and asserting nothing | Always-passes, asserts-nothing    |
| "Run only on Linux because Windows is flaky" | Bug is in your code               |

**Sometimes the test is fine and production has a race.** Tells: fails more under high parallelism; needs multiple threads; adding logging "fixes" it (memory barrier in disguise); fix is "added a lock." Treat as priority bugs.

## Coverage — signal, not goal

Coverage tells you what _ran_. It does not tell you what was _checked_. Smoke detector, not thermometer.

| Kind               | Measures                       | Misses                                                             |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Line/Statement** | Each line ran                  | Branches; assertions                                               |
| **Branch**         | Each branch taken              | Combinations                                                       |
| **Condition**      | Each boolean to T and F        | Combinations                                                       |
| **Mutation score** | Tests fail when code is broken | The actually-useful metric — see `Skill(testing-fuzzing-mutation)` |

**Default to branch coverage** as the reportable number. Line coverage alone hides untested branches.

**Coverage is useful for:** spotting modules at 0%, PR drops on changed files, finding dead code.

**Coverage is not useful for:** proving correctness, comparing teams/projects, justifying release readiness.

**Why 100% is a smell:** tests written just to hit a line (no assertion), tests of trivial getters, "can't happen" branches with contrived inputs, mocks-of-mocks. Marginal cost rises steeply past ~85%; marginal value falls. Most healthy projects: 70-85% branch on parts that matter, _measured_ gaps elsewhere.

**Per-module floors beat global thresholds.** `core/ ≥ 85%`, `cmd/ ≥ 40%`, generated excluded with a comment explaining why.

## Chaos — at the boundary tier

Use chaos when: distributed system, defined SLO, non-obvious failure modes, on-call team that needs muscle memory.

Don't use it for: single-process apps; pre-MVP without basic tests; systems with no kill switch.

**Failure modes worth injecting:** network (latency, loss, partition, DNS), process (kill, pause, restart), resource (CPU, memory, disk, fd), time (skew, jump), dependency (500, slow, wrong data), state (stale/corrupt/cold cache).

**Game days:** scheduled, planned exercises — pick a scenario, write hypothesis, define abort criteria, run, compare, file findings. Run monthly/quarterly.

**CI-integrated chaos:** existing integration tests with injected faults; `toxiproxy` / `tc netem` in test containers. `tc netem` requires `--cap-add=NET_ADMIN`; without it `tc` exits 0 silently and the chaos test passes vacuously. Assert injection with `tc qdisc show` before asserting behavior.

**Steady-state metrics first.** If you can't measure "is the system OK?" in real time, chaos is just sabotage.

## Anti-patterns

- 100% line coverage as a goal
- Retry-on-flake (`--reruns`, `@retry(3)`)
- E2E for everything (ice-cream cone)
- Mocking all collaborators (test is now coupled to implementation)
- Unit tests that talk to real DB/network
- "Investigated, no root cause found" — usually "ran twice, gave up"
- "Add a sleep, it'll be fine"
- Calling a flake "intermittent" — same word, hidden bug
- Re-running CI until green and merging
- Chaos with no SLO, no kill switch, or no runbook
- Coverage as the testing KPI

## Hand-off

Invariants beyond examples: `Skill(testing-property-based)`. Crash-finding + assertion strength: `Skill(testing-fuzzing-mutation)`. TDD: `Skill(tdd)`. Bug triage: `Skill(debugging)` → `Skill(root-cause)`. Language runners: `Skill(python-testing)`, `Skill(go-testing)`, `Skill(rust-testing)`, `Skill(react)`, `Skill(typescript)`.

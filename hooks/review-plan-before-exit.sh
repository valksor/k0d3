# PreToolUse(ExitPlanMode) hook — force a calibrated plan review before a plan is
# presented to the user.
#
# Single-fire per presentation (mirrors verify-before-stop): the FIRST ExitPlanMode
# of a plan is DENIED with an instruction to run /k0d3:review-plan and apply the
# four reviewers' findings; the gate file is ARMED on that deny, so the
# re-presentation after the review passes straight through (gate consumed). The
# gate self-re-arms for the next plan in the session — no persistent ledger.
#
# Why deny-then-allow and not content-hashing: the review EDITS the plan, so the
# re-presented plan has different text. A hash key would re-block in a loop. The
# single-fire gate is loop-safe by construction.
#
# Escape hatch: K0D3_SKIP_PLAN_REVIEW=1 → allow immediately (mirrors
# K0D3_SKIP_VALIDATOR). Per-plan skip: a plan containing the
# `<!-- k0d3:commit-plan -->` sentinel on a standalone line (emitted by
# /k0d3:execute:commit) is allowed without arming the gate — a commit plan is not
# code. Fail-soft: missing jq, unset
# CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR, a non-ExitPlanMode tool, or an un-writable gate dir → exit 0
# (never trap the user in plan mode).
#
# Output contract mirrors completeness-gate.sh: exit 0 + hookSpecificOutput JSON
# with permissionDecision "deny" on the block; exit 0 with no output to allow.

# Commit plans are not code — /k0d3:execute:commit leads the plan it presents with a
# `<!-- k0d3:commit-plan -->` sentinel so this gate skips the 4-reviewer pass on it.
# Match the EXACT marker (close `-->` anchored) on ANY standalone line of the plan, not
# just line 1: /commit appends its Commit Plan to the active plan file, so the marker is
# rarely the literal first line of the presented string. The `^...[[:space:]]*$` anchor
# keeps it to a line of its own (CR absorbed by the trailing class), so an in-prose
# mention or a near-miss like `k0d3:commit-planner` still gets the normal review.
# Accepted false-skip: a real code plan carrying the exact sentinel on its own line (a
# meta-plan documenting this hook, even inside a fenced block) also skips — fine, the
# token is k0d3-internal and the gate is fail-open. Allow immediately and WITHOUT
# touching the single-fire gate, so a code plan later in the session is still reviewed.
#
# awk (one process) yields the 1-based line number of the FIRST standalone-line match,
# or empty if none — used only to enrich the skip log. Preferred over `grep -n | head |
# cut` because awk reads the final record even when the plan has no trailing newline
# (grep's behavior on an unterminated last line is POSIX-undefined), and it carries no
# pipefail/SIGPIPE or colon-split fragility.

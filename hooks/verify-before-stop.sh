# Stop / SubagentStop hook — verify-before-stop gate.
#
# Blocks a stop ONCE when this turn's tool OUTPUT shows an unresolved failure
# (auth/login, build/compile, test failure, command-not-found, non-zero exit) so
# the agent must re-verify the fix or honestly report blocked / needs-input
# instead of claiming success it never checked.
#
# Single-fire: gated on stop_hook_active so it fires at most once per stop
# episode — the model's NEXT stop is always allowed, so an honest "needs input"
# passes straight through and the gate never loops (no persistent ledger).
#
# Scope: scans tool_result blocks only (tool OUTPUT — where the wall lives), not
# the model's own assistant text (where the false "done" lives, and where a
# reviewer subagent legitimately discusses errors). Keeps false positives low.
#
# Fail-soft: any missing tool (jq/python3), absent transcript, or parse error
# allows the stop (exit 0, no output). The signature list below is the tunable
# surface — deliberately high-precision (no bare "error"/"failed"/"no such file").
#
# Output contract: on a match, prints {"decision":"block","reason":"..."} (the
# Stop-hook block schema) to stdout and exits 0. No match → exit 0, no output.

# check covers both wirings — no per-event ledger needed, and no block loop.
